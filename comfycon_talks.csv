Disclose.io - Vulnerability Disclosure and Hacker Safeharbor in 2020,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Casey Ellis,,,,,"After 40 years of hard-fought battles, the Internet has finally reached a place where it knows that hackers aren’t always burglars… Many of us are locksmiths. We think bad, but do good, view technology and often the world in a very different way to the people who build it; and form the immune system for our digitally-connected society.

Of all the problems the internet has, there seems to be one that rules them all: It doesn’t understand how to work with it’s immune system. 

In this keynote I’ll run through the past/present/future of the vulnerability disclosure, and give a run-through of disclose.io: an open-source and vendor-agnostic initiative to make conversations between builders and breakers safe, standardized, and simple. I’ll close with a Call To Action for all participants with simple ways to help and get involved.",30,Y,https://www.youtube.com/embed/fisyZKn71PA?si=C41ZZxC0_8aKLLdh,
"Lies, Deception and Fantasy",ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Sam Crowther,Nick Rienets,,,,"We, the defenders, play in a highly adversarial game. The game is played in the open and the rules require us to hand our adversaries all the information required to defeat us. In this game, the truth will not set you free. This is a game of lies, deception and fantasy and our adversaries have mastered the art of deceit. They operate with full flexibility, no risk and very little impact.

In this keynote we will discuss the strategy for a new defensive model. A model based on a moving target defence and counter deception. A model that is designed to make us hard and expensive to attack. We’ll discuss real world scenarios, demo a working example and leave you with a better understanding of how to ensure that we, the defenders, get to have some fun",35,Y,https://www.youtube.com/embed/TcVMCA8JScU?si=kKPLdhH1aizHoICh,
"OSINT, A learning journey",ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Benzies,,,,,"OSINT is any sort of intelligence gained through any publicly available source. It is used for good, malicious, and fun. I want to focus on each of those points briefly, and introduce you all to a community game that we can all get involved in to learn more!",40,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/2qTWXIL5_9s?si=gH0y5VdxTQfwT9UC,
"Using Interlace for organising tests, and multithreading over targets",ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Michael Skelton,,,,,"A quick primer on how Interlace can be used for ""on the fly"" pentesting or bug bounty tests over large targets, CIDR or glob ranges as well as useful tricks for how it can be deployed to organise and store the results of tests.",,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPnKFgjhlRg?si=m9OXWlDTmr3YOTN7,
Pwnagotchi your new digital pet!,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,George Coldham,,,,,"Do you remember Tamagotchi? Learn about Pwnagotchi your open source, digital pet based on Raspberry Pi Zero W. Don't forget to feed them delicious wifi handshakes as it uses machine learning to understand how to most effectively stuff its face and capture its dinner. Pwnagotchi teaches itself to get better, loves being social and meeting fellow pwnagotchi and best of all doesn't really need any other human input.

Learn what you need to do if you want your own digital pet, what hardware you need and where to buy it, and how to make the magic happen.",30,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds4k0uHCA-g?si=UTJtTboNahW9gOmd,
Access your social media archives!,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Caitlin,,,,,"You can download archives of a lot of your history on social media sites as a result of the GDPR requirements being brought into play.

Let's explore the basic concepts, who's got interesting data, a few things to consider in relation to your personal threat model, and what you can do with your own data!",10,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dDZGscLQ-w?si=pn7OBjSRqmXaJaWD,
How to sort your sabotage plans,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Kirk Nicholls,,,,,There’s a lot of work in maintaining documentation for systems to ensure they are effective for use by someone other than the creator. Many catastrophic incidents in history were caused by a failure to maintain current instructions or reference materials. I’ll talk about ways to handle documentation that has drifted so far apart from their systems that they are either creative lies or functional sabotage instructions.,20,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXPPw7NH_a0?si=3itKGQVSKo68ySom,
Automating the Boring,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Renée ,,,,,"Cyber is schmick! It's pretty! It lets me hunt down bad guys and nuke 'em from orbit!
check that. No, good security is all about making sure your environment is stable, that's all your configurations are consistent.
A brief skim of my bad IT experiences, the poor design and how they makes for easy exploits.",20,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/mF-XVfQvV4s?si=rmigas2X7bGk-1c2,
The CIA Triad: Staying Sane in Crazy Times,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Gyle,,,,,We’re all familiar with the CIA triad since it’s the model that is used to guide policies for information security in an organisational setting. How about if we flip it around as an easy acronym to help us during these extraordinary times we’re experiencing? Join this short session as Gyle talks about the confluence of infosec and psych topics to help make sense of the craziness around us,25,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_SVCj1VKfA?si=s-Xqbevax8VWHnpH,
Dependencies: Barely Managing,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,sh3r4_hax,,,,,"Colloquially, infosec and developers don’t share a unified definition for concepts like “dependency management”. Effective communication is already undermined, so let’s start at first principles and try to understand one another.

Also, I will be presenting as a velociraptor.",15,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVlp2SMrD60?si=QYmlETwbyOTOGYVJ,
Digging Deeper with Velociraptor - DFIR Beast Mode…,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Mike Cohen,,,,,"The old way of performing in-depth forensic analysis and incident response with your existing tools is clearly not adequate or scalable to many endpoints. Velociraptor, an advanced open source endpoint visibility tool, is the ideal tool for effectively investigating, hunting and monitoring your endpoints with minimal fuss.

This will be a quick tour of the latest Velociraptor release. Velociraptor's unique approach to DFIR is its powerful Velociraptor Query Language (VQL) which powers all aspects of the tool. We will see how to quickly customize endpoint collection and analysis by crafting and modifying VQL, how to collect basic artifacts and post process the collected data to quickly identify compromised endpoints at scale. We finally show how automated remediation can be used to quickly remove wide ranging compromise efficiently.",35,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-XOeuT4qg8?si=0-CuffotTluM8gEE,
Vulnerability research as a lifestyle,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Faith ,,,,,"Have you been on twitter recently and seen tweets about people finding vulnerabilities in <insert_software_name_here>? Maybe you've wondered about the sort of skill-set you would need to find these vulnerabilities yourself, and so you read a writeup or two of similar vulnerabilities, only to give up moments later because it gets too overwhelming (and believe me, I know how overwhelming it can be!) Come watch this talk to learn about how you can get started with finding your own vulnerabilities! I assure you it's lots of fun ;)",30,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltYfd4GXags?si=oqQI--0F5PFCdHDD,
Meditation for Crisis Professionals,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Garth,,,,,"For both crisis professionals and professionals in crisis, this session examines the effects of long term stressors, and provides a practical framework on how to manage them. Topics include crowd psychology during disaster events, recognising personal coping mechanisms, cross-cultural contemplation frameworks, and examples of high-stress professionals using said techniques to maintain their ""calm within the storm"".",30,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhtnpzqXBWk?si=M0zSisZ40vSD6IVn,
Fireside chat with Tilley,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Alex Tilley,,,,,"Interesting stories and insights into the world of cybercrime from someone with a unique understanding from a long history.
",,N,,
Why you should go get it…,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Adam McCarthy,,,,,"This talk is about why people should back themselves and go out on their own, start a company, build things that they want to build, work for people they want to work with. Sounds awesome right...  But why do some people fail to take the plunge? Fear of failure?  I hope to pass on my lessons learnt from ParaFlare - good and bad - others stories from start up, and of course, things that make your life easier / harder when going alone.",25,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/IU1rXu4iNyA?si=s6a8O3ryHMAmutvV,
How to keep kickass women in tech - take a lesson from snowboarding,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Toni James,,,,,"What's the point of hiring kickass women if you don't have an environment that supports their growth and desire to stay with your company? This talk provides some concrete ideas on how security and software companies should look outside the tech industry and adopt successful initiatives to increase the participation of women in tech. We talk a mean talk about cultural fit, and then fail to look at industries based on culture that have tackled gender inequality and won.  Burton Snowboards started the Women’s Leadership Initiative which has seen the leadership team grow from 10% female to over 40% in the last 10 years. Nearly everything they do as a company is transferable to the tech industry, so come and see what works for you.",25,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVZI3IeF_6s?si=onwGfqHYEQhKZSwD,
Hanging on the Telephone: Hacking VoIP,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Sarah Young,,,,,"Before security, Sarah spent a decent amount of her career deploying VoIP systems. In this talk, I detail some of the ways that VoIP systems can be hacked and used for nefarious purposes. 

The purpose of this talk is to give an insight into a less well known area of security and hacking. Most people's knowledge focuses more on traditional network infrastructure, cloud and application attacks (which makes sense as there is far more work in that area) but VoIP and telephony is - in my opinion - infinitely interesting and gives attendees an increased knowledge in this area.",35,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6AzG3uyuA0?si=k8FCJZW6DIH0zbZN,
How to Fight a Virus with a Spreadsheet,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Allen Baranov,,,,,Reporting is an important part of Infosec but reports often get ignored. I'll talk through a practical example of a time that I changed the reporting for a large organisation and helped them avoid a potentially catastrophic worm invasion.,30,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/smv7jfbLeP4?si=uflohCUcYZcAgXVb,
Good Incident Response; More Than Just Tech Stuff,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Ryan Janosevic,,,,,"Looking back at some of of the previous Incident Response operations he led, Ryan will give an overview into some of the critical functions and skills required of Incident Response personnel. Hint, its not always technical expertise that makes for great Incident Response (although that's kind of important too!) - so that's what this presentation will focus on, the non-technical side of IR.",25,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFIlscQTC7Y?si=2ghGFT8sJm-e0mfO,
Things to do with a Faraday Cage,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Silvio Cesare,,,,,"I recently bought a commercial desktop Faraday Cage/Box. It has USB, POE, and SMA pass through. It also has power, light, a viewing window and shielded gloves.  If you ever get access to one, this talk might give you some ideas on the things you can do with it. For me, that's setting up a LTE 4G base station and fuzzing the pre-authentication broadcast messages. From outside the box, I remotely manage my target, an Android phone receiving the signals.",20,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/SIKgXWgcu1U?si=PvYhhyzDJnyd-jrH,
Code that gets you pwn(s|'d),ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Louis,,,,,"In this talk, Louis will cover examples of vulnerabilities that are not necessarily obvious. We will look at some snippets in Golang, Ruby, Python..",30,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5_S_Yip3gc?si=M86vP4b-2Q5e9n5E,
Zero Trust ... it is not just about infrastructure,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,TM Ching,,,,,"Zero Trust is probably the most overused buzzword in the industry, and probably the least understood. Some people think you can buy a product that provide Zero Trust ability, but Zero Trust is not a capability ... it is a way of security management. My talk briefly just wants to clear the air about what Zero Trust is all about.",20,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yg_EKCF0ps4?si=6HVrg8KoeXBPP1YG,
Overcoming Cyber Performance Anxiety: The Continuous Cyber Maturity Model,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Andrew Scully,,,,,"Unending data breaches, outages and compromises can leave security senior leadership with “cyber performance anxiety” and organisations asking the question; does our security program REALLY deliver the outcomes we need? Does the program really work?

This discussion will dive into some lessons learnt from the security leadership coal face and will address; how we gain better alignment between security programs and organizational outcomes?",35,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXmr6mepkm0?si=sAfsxiZJa50VqkGQ,
Is there anyone on board who can fly a DevSecOps plane?!,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Hannah McKelvie,,,,,"We are three years into our Enterprise Secure Code program, and last year we embarked on DevSecOps at scale. We are one of Australia's largest Telcos, and we are fundamentally transforming the way our company releases code into production. In this talk I will describe the evolution of the Secure Code team and then walk through examples of how our initiatives are succeeding in helping projects to go live with fewer vulnerabilities and fewer interactions with Cyber Security. I will also share how DevSecOps has evolved for us, who were our stakeholders, how we built and established critical relationships, and look at where we have landed with DevSecOps today, before diving into one of our key initiatives - our Security Champion Program.",0,N,,
An Introduction to Drone Security,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Mike Monnik,,,,,Drones are literally flying laptops. There are a lot of attack vectors that exist but also a number of key things you need to be aware of in the physical and kinetic space; it's no longer a case of simply compromisable IoT. We'll go through the key things you need to know about in the space and how the InfoSec community is barreling into the Aerospace and Force Protection industries.,45,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/VkjsE-RuPwQ?si=dDnpRj-L6KjxPtub,
Security at the speed of DevOps,ComfyCon AU 2020 Winter,4/11/2020,Uday Korlimarla,,,,,"Today, Speed to market is everything. But speed and security can both be achieved at the same time.

In a lightning speed demo, I will walk the audience through creating WebApps at the speed of light while making sure that checks and balances are in place to ensure that Security is a first class citizen. The idea is to help educate DevOps as well as an AppSec audience on things that there are simpler ways to start securing.

In under 30 minutes, the demo will be for the Audience to follow through with me and deploy a modern client-side webapp using ReactJS by creating a simple Serverless Architecture using Firebase.",25,N,https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTfIsDtPVGg?si=l_WdVIOEQa732cBb,
