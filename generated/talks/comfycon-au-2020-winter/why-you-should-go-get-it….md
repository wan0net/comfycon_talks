This talk is about why people should back themselves and go out on their own, start a company, build things that they want to build, work for people they want to work with. Sounds awesome right...  But why do some people fail to take the plunge? Fear of failure?  I hope to pass on my lessons learnt from ParaFlare - good and bad - others stories from start up, and of course, things that make your life easier / harder when going alone.
