Before security, Sarah spent a decent amount of her career deploying VoIP systems. In this talk, I detail some of the ways that VoIP systems can be hacked and used for nefarious purposes. 

The purpose of this talk is to give an insight into a less well known area of security and hacking. Most people's knowledge focuses more on traditional network infrastructure, cloud and application attacks (which makes sense as there is far more work in that area) but VoIP and telephony is - in my opinion - infinitely interesting and gives attendees an increased knowledge in this area.
