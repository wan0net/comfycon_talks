Do you remember Tamagotchi? Learn about Pwnagotchi your open source, digital pet based on Raspberry Pi Zero W. Don't forget to feed them delicious wifi handshakes as it uses machine learning to understand how to most effectively stuff its face and capture its dinner. Pwnagotchi teaches itself to get better, loves being social and meeting fellow pwnagotchi and best of all doesn't really need any other human input.

Learn what you need to do if you want your own digital pet, what hardware you need and where to buy it, and how to make the magic happen.
