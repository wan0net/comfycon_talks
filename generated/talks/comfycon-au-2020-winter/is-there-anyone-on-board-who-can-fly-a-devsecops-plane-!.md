We are three years into our Enterprise Secure Code program, and last year we embarked on DevSecOps at scale. We are one of Australia's largest Telcos, and we are fundamentally transforming the way our company releases code into production. In this talk I will describe the evolution of the Secure Code team and then walk through examples of how our initiatives are succeeding in helping projects to go live with fewer vulnerabilities and fewer interactions with Cyber Security. I will also share how DevSecOps has evolved for us, who were our stakeholders, how we built and established critical relationships, and look at where we have landed with DevSecOps today, before diving into one of our key initiatives - our Security Champion Program.
