Today, Speed to market is everything. But speed and security can both be achieved at the same time.

In a lightning speed demo, I will walk the audience through creating WebApps at the speed of light while making sure that checks and balances are in place to ensure that Security is a first class citizen. The idea is to help educate DevOps as well as an AppSec audience on things that there are simpler ways to start securing.

In under 30 minutes, the demo will be for the Audience to follow through with me and deploy a modern client-side webapp using ReactJS by creating a simple Serverless Architecture using Firebase.
