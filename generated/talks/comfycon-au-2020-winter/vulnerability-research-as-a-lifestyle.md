Have you been on twitter recently and seen tweets about people finding vulnerabilities in <insert_software_name_here>? Maybe you've wondered about the sort of skill-set you would need to find these vulnerabilities yourself, and so you read a writeup or two of similar vulnerabilities, only to give up moments later because it gets too overwhelming (and believe me, I know how overwhelming it can be!) Come watch this talk to learn about how you can get started with finding your own vulnerabilities! I assure you it's lots of fun ;)
