We, the defenders, play in a highly adversarial game. The game is played in the open and the rules require us to hand our adversaries all the information required to defeat us. In this game, the truth will not set you free. This is a game of lies, deception and fantasy and our adversaries have mastered the art of deceit. They operate with full flexibility, no risk and very little impact.

In this keynote we will discuss the strategy for a new defensive model. A model based on a moving target defence and counter deception. A model that is designed to make us hard and expensive to attack. Weâ€™ll discuss real world scenarios, demo a working example and leave you with a better understanding of how to ensure that we, the defenders, get to have some fun
