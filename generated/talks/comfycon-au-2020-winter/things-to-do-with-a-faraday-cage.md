I recently bought a commercial desktop Faraday Cage/Box. It has USB, POE, and SMA pass through. It also has power, light, a viewing window and shielded gloves.  If you ever get access to one, this talk might give you some ideas on the things you can do with it. For me, that's setting up a LTE 4G base station and fuzzing the pre-authentication broadcast messages. From outside the box, I remotely manage my target, an Android phone receiving the signals.
