Australia has an awesome talent pool of cybersecurity professionals & human beings that unfortunately is under the yoke of large businesses that will subjugate awesomeness for mediocrity. I'm personally on a mission to employ said individuals and if I cant, at least help them get out on their own.

This talk will cover:
1) a professionals lifecycle
2) A market analysis
3) most of the things you need to think about before going out on your own
4) Considerations for subcontracting or running a business

If I get time between now and comfycon, I plan to have a wire frame of at least a document and a todo list for the newly emancipated.
