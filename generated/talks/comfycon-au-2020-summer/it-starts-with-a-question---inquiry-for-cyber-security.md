As a cyber security hiring manager, I see one of the key differences between people who are successful and those who struggle is the ability to navigate uncertainty. As new threats and novel attacks continue to challenge the industry, the ability to move forward with limited information is a professional game changer. People who aren't afraid to ask questions and have a framework for seeking answers have a clear advantage when responding to security incidents. This talk examines models of inquiry over history, from Socratic Dialogue to Scientific Method, using defence team examples.
