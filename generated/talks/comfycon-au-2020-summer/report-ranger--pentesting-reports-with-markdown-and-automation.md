We're releasing a new tool for building penetration testing reports called Report Ranger. Using RR you can put vulnerability writeups in your report using Markdown and templating, and it will do all the risk assessments, metadata, sorting, and formatting for you. Meanwhile you can plug information from tools straight into your reports without much fuss and start to automate as much as possible, getting all the rubbish out of the way.
