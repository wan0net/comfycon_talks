Cyber security is emerging as one of Australia’s most promising growth sectors. US$131 billion was spent on the industry in 2017, and this is expected to increase to almost US$250 billion by 2026.
Currently, there is a shortage of skilled cyber security workers around the world. AustCyber’s projections suggest that in Australia this shortage could reach 18,000 within the next decade. So, what are we doing at AustCyber to build a pipeline of skilled cyber security professionals? How are we supporting startups and scale-ups to grow?
In this talk, AustCyber’s CEO Michelle Price shares practical advice about how to grow your business. She also provides information about pathways and opportunities for those interested in establishing a career in the thriving Australian cyber security sector.
