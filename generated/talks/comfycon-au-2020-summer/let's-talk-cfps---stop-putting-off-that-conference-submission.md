So your favourite InfoSecurity conference has just published its Call for Paper (CFP) dates! Your friends and family are encouraging you to apply, but that little voice inside you is telling you all the reasons you shouldn't. Don't listen to that voice! Give yourself an opportunity to share your experience, knowledge and expertise with others.

In this talk I will be discussing the mystery of the CFP and what it should look like. From developing your ideas, thoughts, structure and how to lay it out. What the difference is between submitting to an industry conference vs a community conference, novel vs new speaker talk. Every conference works a little differently, so knowing the conference and your audience will assist in your submission.
Everyone has something worthy to talk about.

Everyone has experience and expertise, so join me as maybe its your time to put yourself forward and submit.
