Clear Cyber Security Strategies and Plans are critical to the success of any security program. Despite this, it is common for organisations and sub teams to interchange Strategies with Plans. The approaches, requirements and benefits of these frameworks differ considerably, and misinterpretation of the strengths and weaknesses can prevent us from harnessing their full potential. Through the analogy of Harry Potter, this talk will educate the audience on: • Order of the Phoenix: What is a strategy and when is it needed? • Horcrux Hunt: What is a plan and when is it needed? • Hogwarts School of Cyber-craft and Strategy: How to write a plan and create a strategy.
