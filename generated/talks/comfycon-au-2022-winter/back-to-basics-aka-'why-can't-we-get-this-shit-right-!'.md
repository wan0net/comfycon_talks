Time and time again - especially recently! - we're seeing breaches occurring because (with 20/20 hindsight, of course!) something incredibly simple was missed. So if it was simple, if it was basic, if it was common sense - why was it missed? This talk will highlight some of the basic security steps that keep being missed, told from the perspective of someone who's been down in the trenches and is now helping other organisations rise to the task of getting all the boring, bland, simple, basic things right - *before* looking at all the new and shiny security tools that are out there. Covering a wide range of topics including identity, server management, hybrid cloud and security systems, this talk will take us all Back to Basics. The basics are your foundations - if you don't get them right, nothing will be right.
