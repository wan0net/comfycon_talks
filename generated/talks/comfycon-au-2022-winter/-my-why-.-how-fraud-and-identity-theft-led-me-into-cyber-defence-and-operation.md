I aim to share two life changing experiences (where a co-worker pulled off a significant financial fraud and being a victim of identity theft) motivated me to relocate to Australia, study Cyber Security and eventually work in Cyber Defence and Operation.
By sharing “My Why” I hope to encourage everyone to find their whys and work towards what inspires them.
