Quantum computers have become a huge buzzword in the last few years, with startups and big tech firms alike promising fantastical outcomes left, right, and centre. In this talk, Eleanor will use their lapsed physics degree to cut through the bullsh*t. They will explain the basics of how quantum computers work, plus what they can and can't bring to the world of infosec. Good to know beforehand: the basics of how digital computers work, and a bit of familiarity with cryptographic concepts like digital signatures and public/private key encryption.
