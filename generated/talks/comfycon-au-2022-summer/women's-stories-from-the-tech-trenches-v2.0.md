In 2019, Jess presented about women's stories from the tech trenches. Well, it's time for v2.0 of that talk from both Jess and Sarah, with new stories from their own experiences as women in tech and from the many female-identifying contributors who also shared their stories. There is still a stigma around talking about discrimination of minorities (however minor it is) so come and help us talk openly about this - not to shame, but to help us all be better and learn from one another to make security a better place for everyone to work, irrespective of gender, ethnicity, etc.
