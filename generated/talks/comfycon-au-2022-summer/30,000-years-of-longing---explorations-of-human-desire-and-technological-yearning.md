What started out as casual bantering in the ComfyCon AU Discord server regarding the lack of submissions in the field of teledildonics has led one of the community members on a side quest.

This is not meant to be a salacious jaunt but rather a technical experiment on what can be uncovered if one goes deeper to dig into the intricacies of these instruments of passion.
