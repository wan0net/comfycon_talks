When was the last time you racked a server or installed a network switch? Today many organisations are using DevOps practices to manage their IT infrastructure. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables platform teams to define and deploy systems using configuration templates and automated pipelines, reducing infrastructure provisioning time to minutes rather than days. However, like anything that contains the word "code", IaC is not immune from vulnerabilities. So how do you integrate security into your IaC development and deployment processes? In her talk, Bronwyn will explain how security can be integrated into the DevOps lifecycle to prevent and detect IaC vulnerabilities and provide some best practices to keep your infrastructure as code deployments secure.
