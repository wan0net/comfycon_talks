Amateur radio is one of those things that most are vaguely aware of as well as totally clueless about. It’s the only hobby that lets you say "I’m a ham radio operator", the response to which is normally feigned interest and an attempt to quickly exit the conversation.

For those of you not quick enough to make your escape, I will address the following attempts to break off from conversation:

I don't know what amateur radio is - a quick introduction to the hobby

I don't have any interest in amateur radio - how to achieve worldwide communications without any public or private intermediate infrastructure

I'm not interested in talking to people on the radio - a discussion of text based and machine to machine modes

I really can't afford a lot of expensive radio equipment - how to make a cheap entry to the hobby

I don't have the space for huge antennas - a discussion of antennas that work in small spaces

Really, my neighbors just wouldn't be OK with me putting up giant antennas - concealed and indoor antennas

I don't know how to get licensed and I really don't want to - how to get licensed
