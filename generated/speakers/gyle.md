Gyle grew up during a brutal dictatorship in a country riddled with all the natural calamities happening on a frequent basis. She has survived wading through dirty flood waters, drinking potentially radioactive Coke and the Y2K bug. Before moving to the tech industry, she trained as a psychologist. Currently, she works as a Cyber Threat Analyst for Cyber Research NZ where she works from home 100%.
