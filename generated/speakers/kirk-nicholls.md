Kirk is a Security Consultant at TSS Cyber in Canberra, joining the team after 10 years in Air Force ICT working on training exercises, drills and emergency response for the military and non-profits. He has been a Dungeon Master for most of his life and found those skills are surprisingly transferable to his work. He now thinks a lot about using games to improve teams, communicate complexity and evaluate responses to crisis.
