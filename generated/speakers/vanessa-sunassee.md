I'm currently the Cybersecurity, Risk & Compliance Lead at Aiculus. I help protect all the critical assets of the business, the technology, hardware, software, people and data. i've worked within the banking sector for 15 years before transitioning to cybersecurity. I've worked on practical implementation of ISO27001 which has helped my organisation and other companies I provide consultancy services, to be certified.
