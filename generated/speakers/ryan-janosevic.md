Ryan has spent his entire career working in cyber - which was entirely by accident! He spent 6 years at the Australian Cyber Security Centre working in the Incident Response team, before heading up the Joint Cyber Security Centre program briefly, as its inaugural National Director. He then jumped across to private industry for a bit, as the Lead for Threat Intelligence and Incident Response at AGL, a major energy provider. Currently, he's the co-founder and Chief Operating Officer at Retrospect Labs, a cyber security startup that specialises in cyber security exercises.
