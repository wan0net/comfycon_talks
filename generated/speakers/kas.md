I'm a Product Security Engineer at SafetyCulture working on manual code review, web app pen testing, security tooling and basically all things AppSec. As part of a small team, I also get some insight into infra/cloud security and Corporate security as well. Previously, I was a Senior Consultant in the Westpac AppSec team managing their devsecops infrastructure and automation.
