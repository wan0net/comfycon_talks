A recent participant in the 2021 cohort of Project Friedman program run by ASD to encourage women to have a greater voice in cybersecurity conferences I am a passionate about the importance of communication as a part of a holistic cybersecurity strategy. Currently, I am the Cybersecurity Segment Marketing Manager for rhipe, a Crayon company where I manage the marketing messaging and strategy for 15 plus global vendors across the IT channel in ANZ and APAC. In previous roles I have worked with cybersecurity vendors of all sizes from start ups and scale ups through to large enterprise level organisations to help them build the value of their brand across ANZ and APAC. Working in multiple roles across nearly 10 years, I have worked in various communications roles - sales, digital campaign manager, social media specialist, webinar host, etc.
