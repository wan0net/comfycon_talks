Cam La is a security consultant who enjoys tea, spends way too much time reading, and deconstructs systems in her spare time.
She has spent over 10 years enjoying the view from ladders, cherry pickers, and building rooftops - engineering, designing and deploying sensors, vision and tech in places they really weren't meant to go.

Making the jump to cyber, Cam now works in Forensic Technology across DFIR, investigations, eDiscovery and compliance for Clayton Utz.
