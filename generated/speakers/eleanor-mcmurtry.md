A lifelong interest in programming and later infosec, Eleanor is a mathematician at heart and does their best to make maths approachable and friendly to the general public. They completed their Master's at the University of Melbourne in 2020, and they are technically a published author (do conference proceedings count?). They enjoy science of all kinds and live with two very fluffy cats.
