I'm a web developer from the tiny business and NFP side of the industry where there's no such thing as a security team or CISO. I care about users (also known as people), so I attend a lot of cyber events, try my best and cross my fingers. Dedicated to actionable security for the rest of us.

Prior to  my tech career I've worked in trade unions, political campaigns, policy and public service management.
