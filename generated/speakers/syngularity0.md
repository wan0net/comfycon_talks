Despite syn firmly believing computers were a mistake, he spends a lot of time discovering new and exciting reasons to dislike them even more. Now comfortable in middle management and consulting, syn is a purveyor of fine PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets (executive fascination tools). When he's not copying and pasting other people's reporting he found on the internet, syn claims he dabbles in Cyber Threat Intelligence and Open Source Intelligence to try and make himself sound cool. It has been assessed with high confidence that this TTP has not succeeded.
