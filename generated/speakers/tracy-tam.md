After graduating with an engineering degree, I worked for a decade as an engineer within the IT industry. After leaving to start my own small business, I experienced first-hand the cyber-security challenges between technology & human. Winning at AustCyber's Defence Industry Cyber Challenge led me on a journey to make cyber-security approachable for small businesses. Investigating small business cyber-security is my research focus as a doctoral candidate at RMIT University.
