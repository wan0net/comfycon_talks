Hacker, tinkerer, car modder, husband and "the dog guy". I've been doing various security things for 10+ years. My first experience with hacking was at about 6 years old when my dad taught me to use Game Wizard to hack the memory of old games. Now I'm Co-Founder and Offensive Director of Volkis, a Sydney-based infosec firm.
